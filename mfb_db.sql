I\'ve included some screenshots of an SQLite3 session where I display column names and some of the rows\' data found in the tables, accessed from a Linux terminal. (In case you were wondering what the giant grey thing is on the bottom right of the main image above, I tweaked my Ubuntu CSS to make all the scrollbars jumbo size, cause the tiny sliver-sized scrollbars on default Ubuntu are super annoying to try to click on. It took about 10 hours to get it right and Ubuntu developers should make this an option through the GUI. I put the CSS code on my github if you\'re interested - link is below.)\r\n\r\nIn the first screenshot below, you can see 4 classes, each one used to access a table. The first one is for the table where information about the posts on the blog are stored. Whenever a new \"Post\" instance is created, it gets a bunch of instance variables: it automatically gets its own id number, which is used to locate it, as well as a title, a date posted, a quantity of text (what you\'re reading here for this particular post - all this text was found in the \"post\" table on the server),  the filename and caption for the main image, the filename and captions of any additional information, and two final columns for a link URL (link_href) and a description of the website the link points to (link_description). Each of these instance variables points to a column in the \"post\" database.\r\n\r\nIn the following screenshots of code, you can see how the Python code creates, accesses, changes, and deletes information from the \"post\" database. This got tricky when I was figuring out how to allow the admin to submit up to 10 additional photos along with optional captions for each one.\r\n\r\nWhile writing the code, I used the terminal to set up, access, and change the database as I went along, while the app itself uses SQLAlchemy to interact with it.',1,'images/image2.png','SQLite3 Session',5,'images/image2A.png~Python classes used to access the SQL database|images/image2B.png~Create New Post code.
