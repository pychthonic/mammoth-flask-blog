Check out the code in action at:

Flask-based web app with image carousel, pdf viewer and uploader, information submission, nba stat database search, etc.

It looks good on both computers and mobile phones.

It uses Talisman and other precautions for protection against XSS attacks and SQL injections.

The code needs to be cleaned up and pep8-ified. I'm going to add a little bit more functionality to the nba stat search,
clean the code up so it's easier to read, then put it up on the world wide web. I'll post the link when that happens.

Below is a screenshot of the front page of the app:
